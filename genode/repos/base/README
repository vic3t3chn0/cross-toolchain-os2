This is generic part of the Genode implementation. It consists of two parts:

:_Core_: is the ultimate root of the Genode application tree
  and provides abstractions for the lowest-level hardware resources
  such as RAM, ROM, CPU, and generic device access. All generic parts of Core
  can be found here - for system-specific implementations refer to the
  appropriate 'base-<system>' directory.

:_Base libraries and protocols_: that are used by each Genode component
  to interact with other components. This is the glue that holds everything
  together.

_Core_ may export information about the hardware platform by an ROM
called 'platform_info'. Depending on the platform, e.g. ARM or x86 or riscv,
and depending on the boot mode and boot loader and kernel, some nodes may not
be populated.

!<platform_info>
! <acpi revision="2" rsdt="0x1fe93074" xsdt="0x1fe930e8"/>
! <boot>
!   <framebuffer phys="0x7300000" width="1024" height="768" bpp="32"/>
! </boot>
!</platform_info>

If the ACPI RSDT and XSDT physical pointer is reported by the used kernel
and/or bootloader, _Core_ may provide this information by the ROM.

If the graphic device is initialised and can be directly used by a framebuffer
driver, _Core_ may provide the physical pointer to the framebuffer, the
resolution and color depth in bits.
