This plugin provides resource-optimized FAT and exFAT support to the VFS library.

Usage
~~~~~

The plugin takes two configuration options as XML attributes, 'codepage' and 'drive'.
A codepage number is required only for non-ASCII filename support. The 'drive' option
takes an integer value between 1 and 10 and is simply a symbolic identifier passed
thru the Block session request. In this manner multiple drives are supported.

Codepages
~~~~~~~~~

Support for non-ACII filenames is experimental and only one codepage
may be in use for any number of drives.

Caching
~~~~~~~~

This plugin may cache some file data but schedules a full write cache flush a few
seconds after any write operation. If a read caching is desired, please use the
'block_cache' component to cache at the block device.
