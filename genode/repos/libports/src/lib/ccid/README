Configuration:

The CCID library loads the '/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist" file, which
can be made available from a ROM module in the VFS of the application:

When the CCID library is built, it creates a file 'Info.plist' in the 'bin'
directory, which contains information about the supported card readers.
This file is loaded by the library at runtime as
'/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist' and can be made accessible at this
location in the VFS configuration of the application:

<config>
	<libc>
		<vfs>
			<dir name="ifd-ccid.bundle">
				<dir name="Contents">
					<rom name="Info.plist"/>
				</dir>
			</dir>
		</vfs>
	</libc>
</config>
