The 'verify' component verifies detached OpenPGP signatures. Its configuration
accepts any number of '<verify>' nodes of the following form:

! <verify path="/path/to/data" pubkey="/pubkey"/>

The detached signature file is expected to be named after the data file with
the additional suffix '.sig'. The 'path' and 'pubkey' attributes refer to
paths within the component's local VFS.

The results of the signature checks are provided in the form of a report
with the label "result". For each '<verify>' node of the configuration, this
report contains a node of type '<good>' or '<bad>'. In either case, the node
contains the corresponding 'path' as attribute. Furthermore, '<bad>' nodes
feature diagnostic information as a 'reason' attribute.

For an example scenario, refer to the _ports/run/verify.run_ script.

Disclaimer: The component does not perform time-related plausibility checks
such as scrutinizing the creation date of the public key.
