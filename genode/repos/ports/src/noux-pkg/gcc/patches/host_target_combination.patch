host_target_combination.patch

From: Christian Prochaska <christian.prochaska@genode-labs.com>

Remove sanity check for host/target combination in configure script of
libstdc++. An alternative fix would be the addition of a new host or
the use of an existing one. However, adding a new host would require
us to maintain a larger patch to the GCC build system, and using an
existing host comes with all the (possibly unwanted) policies associated
with the respective host platform. We want to stick with the bare-bone
compiler as much as possible.
