This directory contains the implementation of a framebuffer driver which
relies on a pre-intialised graphic device, e.g. by BIOS/UEFI or bootloader.

Behavior
--------

The driver looks for a ROM named 'platform_info' with the following XML
nodes and attributes:

<platform_info>
	<boot>
		<framebuffer phys="0x7300000" width="1024" height="768" bpp="32"/>
	</boot>
</platform_info>

If the framebuffer node exists and all attributes, the driver opens up a
IO_MEM session with the given physical addres as framebuffer memory and
renders the framebuffer content into the given area.
