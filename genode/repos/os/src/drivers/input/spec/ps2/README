The PS/2 driver makes PS/2 mouse and keyboard input available as an input
session. It accepts the following configuration attributes. The default
values are shown as attribute values.

! <config verbose_keyboard="no"
!         verbose_mouse="no"
!         verbose_scancodes="no"
!         capslock_led="no"
!         numlock_led="no"
!         scrlock_led="no"/>

The 'capslock_led', 'numlock_led', and 'scrlock_led' attributes can have the
values "no" (LED is turned off), "yes" (LED is turned on), or "rom". In the
latter case, the PS/2 driver reads the LED state from a dedicated ROM module
called "capslock", "numlock", or "scrlock" respectively. The ROM module is
expected to have a top-level XML node with the attribute 'enabled' set to
"yes" or "no". The PS/2 driver supports dynamic updates of its configuration
as well as the ROM modules for LED states. This mechanism enables other
components to control the indicator states by the means of providing and
updating those ROM modules.
