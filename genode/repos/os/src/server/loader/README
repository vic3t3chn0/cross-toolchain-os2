This directory contains a loader service, which allows for the instantiation of
subsystems via a session interface. The resources for the new subsystem are
provided by the client when opening the session. The client has no control over
the functioning of the subsystem except for the controlling the lifetime of the
subsystem.

By default, the loaded subsystem can access only those ROM modules that were
loaded into the loader session by the loader client. However, it is possible
to define a whitelist of ROM modules to be obtained from the loader's parent.
For an example, refer to the example 'run/loader.run' script.
