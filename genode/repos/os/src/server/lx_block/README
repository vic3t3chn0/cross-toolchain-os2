This directory contains an Genode Block service that uses a file on
a Linux system as backing store.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backing store is specified by the 'file' attribute. The pretended
block size is specified by the 'block_size' attribute. In case it is
omitted, a default block size of 512 bytes is used. To allow write
access, the 'writeable' attribute must be set to 'yes'. By default only
read-only access it allowed.

An example configuration is shown in the the following config snippet:

!<config file="/foo/bar/block.img" block_size="512" writeable="yes"/>


Notes
~~~~~

The backing file is opened with blocking semantics and thereby the block
session is used synchronously.
