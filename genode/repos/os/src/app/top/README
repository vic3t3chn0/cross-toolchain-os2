This component obtains the information about the existing trace subjects from
core's "TRACE" service and shows via the LOG session the highest CPU consumer
per CPU in percentage.

Configuration
-------------

The interval of output generation can be defined via the 'period_ms' attribute
of the '<config>' node. The value is specified in milliseconds.
The threads with the top most execution time are shown per CPU. The sorting
of the execution time can be shown per thread ('ec' - execution context) or,
if supported by the kernel, per scheduling context of a thread ('sc').

The following example shows the default values.

! <config period_ms="5000" sort_time="ec"/>
