       Subsystem for presenting GUI applications in floating windows


The package uses the motif-inspired default decorator. The decorator is
executed in a sub-init instance according to 'decorator_init.config'. This
allows us to easily override the decorator with another implementation (like
the themed decorator) provided by another package while keeping the overall
configuration of the wm subsystem.

As another advantage of hosting the decorator in a dedicated init instance,
it is possible to restart or replace the decorator at runtime by serving
the 'decorator_init.config' from a dynamic ROM service.
