TCP terminal is a service that provides Genode's terminal-session interface
via individual TCP connections. It supports multiple clients. The TCP port
to be used for each client is defined in as session policy in the config node
of the TCP server:

! <config>
!   <policy label_prefix="client" ip="10.0.0.5" port="8181"/>
!   <policy label_prefix="another_client" port="8282"/>
! </config>

If only a port is described in the policy the TCP terminal will listen on
that port for incomming connections. If an IP address is provided additionally,
it connects to the IP address using the given port.

For an example of how to use the TCP terminal, please refer to the run script
at 'gems/run/tcp_terminal.run'.
