The fs_tool component performs a sequence of file operations on a locally
configured VFS. The file operations are given the configuration as follows:

! <config exit="yes">
!   <vfs>
!     ...
!   </vfs>
!   <remove-file path="/path/to/file" />
! </config>

The 'exit="yes"' attribute instructs the component to exit after completing
the sequence. Otherwise, the component keeps responding to configuration
changes by executing the operations found in the updated configurations.
