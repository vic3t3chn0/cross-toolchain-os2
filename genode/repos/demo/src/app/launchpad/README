Launchpad is a graphical application for interactively starting and
killing programs.

By default, launchpad displays a onfigured list of programs and their
respective default memory quotas. The user can tweak the memory quota for each
entry with mouse and then start a program by clicking on its name. The
following example configuration tells launchpad to display a list of three
launcher entries:

!<config>
!  <launcher name="sdl_pathfind" ram_quota="10M" caps="50"/>
!  <launcher name="liquid_fb"    ram_quota="10M" caps="50"/>
!  <launcher name="hello"        ram_quota="1M"  caps="50"/>
!</config>
