USB NIC driver
##############

Driver for network interface cards connected via USB.

Configuration snippet:

!<start name="usb_net_drv">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M"/>
!  <provides> <service name="Nic"/> </provides>
!  <config mac="2e:60:90:0c:4e:01" />
!</start>

There is the 'mac' attribute where one can specify the hardware address of
the network interface. This is necessary in case the EEPROM of the network card
cannot be accessed via the host controller making it impossible to retrieve the
devices hardware address. If this is the case and no 'mac' attribute is given a
fallback address will be assigned to the network device. Note that the fallback
address will always be the same.
