This driver is for the i.MX8MQ EVK Board.

Default behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When no configuration is provided to the driver, it will enable the HDMI
connector and use the best resolution as provided by EDID information from
the HDMI display.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The HDMI connector can be configured explicitly in terms of resolution and
whether it should be enabled or not. This looks like the following:

! <config>
!   <connector name="HDMI-A-1" width="1920" height="1080" hz="60" enabled="true"/>
! </config>

When the configuration changes during run-time, the driver will adapt to it.

To present all available connectors and their possible resolutions to the user
the driver is able to export a corresponding report ROM. This has to be
configured too, like in the following:

! <config>
!   <report connectors="yes"/>
! </config>

The exported report has the following format:

! <connectors>
!   <connector name="HDMI-A-1" connected="1">
!     <mode width="1920" height="1080" hz="60"/>
!     ...
!   </connector>
! </connectors>
